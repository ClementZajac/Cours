A new dog attack, or a piece of lies?
On a raining day on Tall Tale Pack, Mr Jonse tell us that he was attacked and bit by a dog, but he only tell to the warden that dog as not to be allowed anymore on this park.
By the way, the dog owner tells us that Mr Jonse come over him to kick his dog, and a witness saw the dog jump on Mr Johnse when the two man where shouting at each other.4
The neighbour of the dog owner knows the dog, and said that he is gentle

Is mister Jonse just attacked the dog and his owner because he hates dogs? The police investigation will tell us the truth !
